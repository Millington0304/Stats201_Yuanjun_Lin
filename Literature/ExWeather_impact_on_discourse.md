## "How does extreme weather impact the climate change discourse? Insights from the Twitter discussion on hurricanes" by Maddalena Torricelli et al. (2023)
### Overview
It is more of an exploration of the interplay between extreme weather events and the climate change discourse, emphasizing the critical role of social media in shaping public perceptions and the broader climate change narrative. The study's methodological approach, as illustrated in the flowchart, provides a rather clear roadmap for dissecting and understanding the complex web of discussions that emerge in the wake of such events, finally contributing valuable insights to the fields of climate communication and policy development.

### Detailed version
This article delves into the intricate relationship between extreme weather events and public discourse surrounding climate change, with a particular focus on the social media platform Twitter. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes has spurred significant public and media discussions, which in turn play a pivotal role in shaping societal perceptions and attitudes towards climate change and the urgency of climate action.\
At the heart of this investigation is the pressing research question: How do hurricanes influence the public and media discourse on climate change on platforms like Twitter, and what are the implications for public awareness and policy advocacy? This question is pivotal in understanding the dynamics of climate change communication in the digital age, where social media platforms serve as crucial arenas for public discourse and opinion formation.\
The methodology adopted in this study, as illustrated in the provided flowchart, begins with an extensive data collection phase, where 65 million Twitter posts and 240 thousand news media articles related to 18 major hurricanes from 2010 to 2022 are analyzed. This step is crucial for capturing a comprehensive snapshot of the discourse surrounding these extreme weather events. Following data collection, the study employs topic modeling to sift through the vast dataset and identify the predominant themes in the discussions. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the discourse, highlighting the key concerns and topics that emerge in the wake of hurricanes. The subsequent phase of geolocated analysis further refines the study's insights by examining how the discourse varies between regions directly affected by hurricanes and those that are not, as depicted in the flowchart's third step.\
The results of this methodical investigation reveal a notable increase in climate change discussions in the aftermath of hurricanes, especially in regions directly impacted by these extreme weather events. This finding underscores the role of personal experience and proximity to disaster in shaping public discourse on climate change. Additionally, the study highlights the significant influence of news media in guiding the conversation, with a concerning trend of unreliable outlets often spreading misinformation and conspiracies related to climate change.\
The intellectual merits of this study lie in its contribution to the understanding of how public discourse on climate change is influenced by real-world events like hurricanes. By dissecting the nuances of this discourse, the paper sheds light on the complexities of communicating climate science and the challenges posed by misinformation and polarized opinions. On a practical level, the insights garnered from this research hold profound implications for policymakers, educators, and climate advocates. The paper suggests that effective communication strategies, grounded in an understanding of the discourse dynamics unveiled by this study, are essential for fostering informed public opinion and galvanizing support for robust climate action.
