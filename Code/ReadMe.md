**Data acquisition**\
-Use the command line batch file to obtain the required dataset from NOAA

**Data visualization**\
-Due to the size of the dataset and transfer speed from the original source, having the data locally is highly recommended\
-Some imported libraries/modules should be installed in order to run

**Visualizations**
-Interactive graph with time slider showing the precipitation pattern in US CORUS with a linear scale
-Similar graph but replace the data with anomaly, with normal data from 1901-2000.
