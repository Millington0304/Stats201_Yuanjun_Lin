In these files, monthly maximum, minimum and mean temperature (deg. C. to 100ths) and precipitation (mm to 100ths) are computed for each month from 1895-present. The latest month is appended to these period of record
NetCDF files and are based on the GHCN dataset using a 5km gridded approach. 
The actual grid is 1/24th of a degree. The 1385x596 grid covers CONUS but the non-land points are filled with NaN.In these files, monthly maximum, minimum and mean temperature (deg.
